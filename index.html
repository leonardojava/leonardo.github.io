    <p>Hi, I'm a student at Everett Community College working towards my AA with an interest in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>Hopefully I'll be able to transfer to a 4 year university like UW Seattle and graduate to become a Software Engineer.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, I'll keep pursuing my love for software development. Currently I am interning at a nonprofit as a webdeveloper </p>
    <p>and enjoy coding projects and doing leetcode for fun in my freetime. For example a project I made for my girlfriend above :)</p>
